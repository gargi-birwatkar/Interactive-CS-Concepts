# Interactive CS Concepts

This repository is a collection of **interactive, web-based simulations** designed to demystify fundamental Computer Science principles. Our goal is to provide **real-time visual feedback** on complex operations, transforming abstract theory into concrete, educational demonstrations.

## 🗂️ Simulations Overview

The repository is structured with two sub-folders, each containing a self-contained visualization project:

| Directory | Concept | High-Level Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `simd-architecture-flow` | **SIMD Parallelism** | Visualizes the single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) architectural model, demonstrating its use in efficient parallel tasks like **image processing**.  |
| `shortest-path-algorithms` | **Graph Algorithms** | An interactive tool for exploring and tracing key pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, A\*).  |

## 🚀 Getting Started

Since these are pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript simulations, no build process or server is required.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gargi-birwatkar/Interactive-CS-Concepts.git
    ```
2.  **Run a Simulation:**
    Navigate to the relevant folder and open the main `.html` file in your web browser.

**For detailed usage instructions, feature walkthroughs, and conceptual explanations, please refer to the specific `README.md` file within each simulation's directory.**
